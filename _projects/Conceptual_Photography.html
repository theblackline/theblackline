Life can be smooth and rough and a lot more. This for me shows the tension that we build in life by complicating it. How we stretch and over focus on things that maybe never needed that much attention. But it also shows how mindful life can be. How you can sit and asses each thread of your life and its branching hair. 
The complexity and simplicity I am able to portray in this image is what makes it my favourite.
