My journey with illustration started out of fascination, a single message can be portrayed in such variant ways and later be interpreted into many more. That is magical, according to me.  
Whereas, writing always flows naturally for me. It feels effortless and smooth and has always been my go to medium of expression and communication. 
On the other hand, I love the idea of capturing my surroundings into pixels that surprisingly add a new layer to what we assume reality, and this is where film and photography came into my life.
