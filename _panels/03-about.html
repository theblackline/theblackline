Art has always been intertwined in my life; I have been both a spectator and a contributor. There were many things I wanted to be in life but it was always under the shelter of art. 
During my Interior Design course I saw beauty in the collaboration between all mediums of expression. My list of intrests grew and so did my skill sets. 
After my graduation I followed my heart into many directions. I worked as a set dresser, graphic designer, social media manager, content writer, videographer, film editor and what ever else I could find space in. I hope to continue for more.
